# JavascriptQuiz

My assignment was to create a Javascript coding quiz with 5 questions. Each correct answer gives the user 10 points, and each wrong answer takes 10sec off the users time. They are given 75 seconds to complete the quiz, and if they do not complete it within the time limit, the user will go back to the home screen.
